## Context {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Mozambique is vulnerable to climate change

- High-reliance on rain-fed agriculture
- Increased occurrence of droughts
- Delay in the start of the rainy season

Stakeholders

  - Mozambican Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADER)
  - National Institute of Meteorology (INAM)

## Objectives

Improve early warning/action for drought and agricultural practices with stakeholders

- Developing satellite drought indicators at a kilometer sampling scale
- Integration of early warning system tools for drought monitoring
- Gender sensitive capacity development of project beneficiaries 

## Detecting Droughts {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Rain gauges
- Field soil moisture sensors
- Microwave Satellites
  + continuous (all weather, day-and-night)
  + km sampling scale

:::{.notes}
Rain gauges: indirect measure
In situ soil moisture sensors very accurate measurement of a particular point and depth
Satellites can cover whole geographic ares
There can not be said whether one is better then the other
It all depends on the application - in fact in the project we use both
Remote sense data can be of particular value in areas where there is not good sensor network for measuring soil moisture
It is then a very cost effective solution to give insights on soil conditions - basically we have data lying around we just need to extract he relevant information

## Microwave Backscattering

![https://hubblesite.org](assets/images/electromagnetic_spectrum.png)

:::{.notes}
Microwaves: centimeter to sub-milimeter wavelength.    
Why microwave? Interactions with objects are governed by other physical processes than the visible or infrared EM domain.    
Energy of microwaves reflected from a leaf are indicative of the leaf's proportions and water content rather then chlorophyll.     
Dielectric properties: the frequency dependent radiative/absorptive properties (i.e. the physical make-up of the object).

Dielectric potential of soil with and without water.    
Historic data, oscillations in content according to seasons and long term trends.    
This kinds of products are also produced at near real-time.

::: {.notes}
More of the same, just the show the year by year changes of an orbit overpass in June.
Here one sees that the yearly distribution of drought/wetness of soil does not have to be the same -> highlite the importance of remotely sensed data with that resolves a whole geographic area.

## In Situ Soil Moisture {.smaller}

 - 2023 in-situ installation
 - General lack of in-situ data for product validation in Mozambique
 - 4 depths (10, 20, 50cm)
 - Daily update to the cloud
