## Context {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Mozambique is vulnerable to climate change

- High-reliance on rain-fed agriculture
- Increased occurrence of droughts
- Delay in the start of the rainy season

## Objectives

- Developing satellite drought indicators at a kilometer scale resolution over Mozambique
- Integration of early warning system tools for drought monitoring
- Gender sensitive capacity development of project beneficiaries 

## Detecting Droughts

- Rain gauges/sensors
- Microwave Satellites
  + continuos (all weather, day-and-night)
  + high resolution

## Microwave backscattering

:::{.notes}
Microwaves: centimeter to sub-milimeter wavelength.    
Why microwave? Interactions with objects are governed by other physical processes than the visible or infrared EM domain.    
Energy of microwaves reflected from a leaf are indicative of the leaf's proportions and water content rather then chlorophyll.     
Dielectric properties: the frequency dependent radiative/absorptive properties (i.e. the physical make-up of the object).

Dielectric potential of soil with and without water.    
Historic data, oscillations in content according to seasons and long term trends.    
This kinds of products are also produced at near real-time.
